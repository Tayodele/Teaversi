# Teaversi
My girlfriend didn't want to play reversi for me, so I wrote a bot that would instead.

## Bot Algorithm
* Board is seperated by each corner with 4 layers of quarter circlSe rings. corners are high value, corner ring is bad value, 3rd and fourth ring are ok in value.
* bot is greedy: takes value of space and value of potential captures and maximizes value for the current state.

## This is a lazy side project I made in boredom
* Console reversi game (with colors!!)
* no human error checking (if player makes illegal move bot just takes it)
* no win checking
* but the bot is pretty cool.
